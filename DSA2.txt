Stack
You are given a sequence of n positive integers, and let's say you are filling a stack by adding elements of this sequence one by one starting from the first element. and whenever the element which you are going to add to the stack has set bits equal to the set bits of the top element of the stack, then the top element pops out of the stack and current remains as it is. This operation continues, till the current element set bits are not equal to the set bits of top of the stack.

Modulo Arithmatics
Define modulo arithmetic and explain its significance in programming
Given an integer N, find the sum of i*j for each pair (i, j) such that 1 <= i < j <= N.

Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.
<b>Note</b>
Look at the explanation in Sample Input and Output section.

Linked List
